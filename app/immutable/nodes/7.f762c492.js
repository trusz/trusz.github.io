has to moderate the meeting and see to it that it has an outcome.

Let people prepare.
Some topics can be prepared in advance or at least people can think about it. It also helps to focus on the essentials or shorten the meeting.<br/> <em>If you don’t do it:</em> invitations are not accepted and a lot of time is spent on the topic introduction.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Check if everybody is available.</strong> Calendar applications can check
if everyone has time or when everyone has a free slot.<br/> <em>If you don’t do it:</em> some will accept the invitation and plan with it but others will cancel it and so you have to postpone the appointment which can lead to irritation.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Book adequately large room.</strong> If only three people attend do not book the largest room. If six people are attending do not book the room with two chairs.
If there are remote participants, book a room with needed tech.<br/> <em>If you don’t do it:</em> it will lead to an unpleasant situation. Either it will be ineffective or too cozy.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Invite early.</strong> If the meeting is to be held tomorrow and it is almost closing time, check with everyone personally.
Some people may already be off from work and will not see your invitation until the next day.
Depending on the duration of the meeting, you may want to invite people several days in advance, preferably when you know the date of the meeting.<br/> <em>If you don’t do it:</em> possibly no one will show up.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Cancel/postpone in time</strong>. Just as with invitations, remember that people may not realize the change until it is too late. S
ending a cancellation for an appointment for 08:00 at 07:30 is too late.<br/> <em>If you don’t do it:</em> people will show up unnecessarily.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Do not do it</strong>. Honestly, meetings should be the last resort to solve a problem.
